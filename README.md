# UTM Centre For Student Aid - Component Library

Welcome to the first component library. Our component library will be based on the [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/), which means all the documentation provided on the will apply here.

## Programming Languages

For this component library, we are using ReactJs coupled with Typescript.

## Custom components

We will include the things _necessary_ and leave out the things that the Chakra-UI team already has for us.

For example, we will **not** provide a component for the button, but we will apply custom styles for our particular use case.

Feel free to add more components as the site is still growing.

## Theme

You can find the theme under `Theme/theme.tsx`. This theme will outline many things, such as but not limited to:

- Colours
- Typography Sizes
- and many others.
